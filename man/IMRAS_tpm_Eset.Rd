\title{transcripts per million (tpm) of IMRAS study}
\format{a \code{ExpressionSet} containing the following fields:
\describe{assayData and phenoData}}
\source{
The data comes from RNASeq fasta files.
}
\description{
Contains two tables: assayData which contains tpm counts where the
rows are genes and columns are samples and phenoData which contains
experimental design metadata where each row is a sample and each column
is a factor describing each sample. The rows of phenoData map to the
columns of assayData. The assayData and phenoData tables can be extracted
with \code{exprs(IMRAS_tpm_Eset)} and \code{pData(IMRAS_tpm_Eset)} respectively.
